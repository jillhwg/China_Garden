# China Garden Week Analysis

## Project Background

China Garden, an established Chinese American restaurant, has been an integral part of the Haines City community for over a decade. In response to the challenges presented by the recent pandemic, we are conducting a comprehensive analysis of revenue and sales trends. This analysis will dive into the current key performance metrics, identify emerging patterns, and develop strategic recommendations to enhance operational efficiency across both sales, marketing and labor divisions.

## Executive Summary

Based on an analysis of 2,355 transactions during May 2020, China Garden generated $13,208 in revenue, with Friday, Saturday, and Monday accounting for 45% of total sales. Dinner combination plates constituted approximately 30% of menu item revenue. Analysis indicates a consistent decrease in order volume at 3 PM, presenting an opportunity for implementing structured employee breaks to enhance team productivity before the evening peak period, which comprises 70% of daily orders, particularly around 5 PM. Additional data insights suggest opportunities for strategic menu optimization through product bundling, which could enhance China Garden's market positioning by offering curated combination options aligned with demonstrated customer preferences.

    - C17 Boneless Spare Ribs + Krab Rangoon



## Recommendations

Based on this analysis, we have identified that Krab Rangoon frequently appears in orders alongside popular dinner entrées—specifically General Tso's Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Boneless Spare Ribs, and Fried Chicken Wings. This presents an opportunity to introduce new combination offerings. Given that Chinese-American restaurants operate with similar menus, our competitive edge must extend beyond traditional differentiators of food quality and location. We propose introducing specialized combination packages to differentiate our establishment from local competitors, potentially driving customers acquisition through a targeted city-wide advertising campaign. Additionally, to enhance operational efficiency, we recommend implementing a staggered break schedule during the low-volume period of 2:00–3:00 PM. Under this system, kitchen staff would rotate breaks in two shifts: the first group from 2:00–2:30 PM and the second from 2:30–3:00 PM, ensuring continuous service while maintaining optimal staffing levels.
